Crack Classification &amp; Segmentation in Concrete Images
Crack Classification & Segmentation in Concrete Images

Project Overview

This project focuses on the classification and unsupervised segmentation of crack images in concrete surfaces using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of 40,000 images (50% cracked, 50% intact) from Kaggle, captured at a resolution of 227Ã—227 pixels. The objective is to first train a highly accurate classification model and then perform unsupervised segmentation on positively classified crack images.

Project Structure

Part 1: Crack Classification
Model Selection & Development
Implement a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) for binary classification.
Achieve a classification accuracy of 98% to minimize false positives/negatives.
Explore feature extraction techniques to enhance model performance.
Data Processing & Loader
Implement a data loader to preprocess images and feed them into the model.
Apply an 80%-15%-5% train-validation-test split.
Ensure at least 10 test samples for final evaluation.
Performance Optimization
Tune hyperparameters and experiment with data augmentation.
Use techniques like transfer learning, fine-tuning, or ensemble models to improve accuracy.


Part 2: Crack Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)
Segmentation Approach
Extract positively classified crack images.
Cluster pixels using unsupervised methods (k-means).
Encode pixel-wise features for better segmentation.
Noise Reduction & Post-Processing
Combine multiple clustering methods to refine segmentation.
Implement heuristic-based post-processing to clean noisy segments.
Evaluation & Validation
Manually label 10-20 images using LabelMe.
Convert JSON annotations into masks and compare them with generated masks.
Visualize and compare ground truth vs. predicted segmentation.
